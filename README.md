### Background

This program demonstrates how Machine Learning can forecast a future closing price of a chosen stock. This program is for training purposes only and should not be used for real investment decisions.<br>

The program 'scrapes' historical stock price data from the Yahoo! Finance site. These data are used to 'train' a regression algorithm in order to forecast a future closing price for the stock. Three common ML regression algorithms are used: decision tree, linear, and K-Nearest Neigbors.
### How to use
Upload the Jupyter Notebook file to your Google Drive and open with Google Colab. 
Ensure that you're logged into Google Drive with your account â€“ you'll need this to upload some financial data.
Start at the 'Import Dependencies' block below and work down.

Fill in the fields on the right-hand side of each 'block', then click on the play icon inside the square bracket at the top left of each block.<br> Blocks can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the triangle next to the block name.
Run each block in sequence from top to bottom; if you change any values, then re-run the sequence all the way to the bottom.
